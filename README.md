üìñ Overview

The algorithm integrates a "Spiking Neural Network (SNN) reservoir" with "LSTM-based classifiers" for EEG-based depression identification. The pipeline consists of three major stages:

1. Preprocessing

   EEG data cleaning and formatting.
   Anonymization and feature extraction.
   Segmentation into epochs using a sliding window with overlap.

2. NeuCube SNN Reservoir

   EEG samples are converted into spike trains using NeuCube.
   The spatio-temporal spiking patterns are encoded across a 3D SNN reservoir.
   The resulting spike outputs are stored in `out_neucube_open.h5`.

3. Classification

   The spike-encoded data are processed with LSTM networks.
   Different tasks supported:

     Regression (depression severity levels).
     Binary classification (e.g., depressed vs. non-depressed).
     Multi-class classification** (non, minimal, moderate, severe).
     Cross-validation (10-fold) ensures robust evaluation.

	"samples" ‚Üí spike data shaped `(patients √ó timesteps √ó neurons)`

üöÄ Pipeline Description

1. Preprocessing

Segmentation: EEG signals are split into 5-second windows with 90% overlap.
Padding/Cropping: Ensures all epochs have equal length.
Label Mapping: Depression labels were mapped into 2 or 4-class categories depending on the task.
HDF5 Storage: Segmented and spike-transformed data are saved in `out_neucube_open.h5`.

2. NeuCube Spiking Reservoir

Raw EEG ‚Üí spike encoding using NeuCube architecture.
3D SNN reservoir models brain-like spatio-temporal dynamics.
Extracted spike trains serve as input to downstream ML models.

3. Classification (Deep Learning)

Model: A stacked LSTM + Dense feed-forward classifier.

Input shape: (epochs √ó timesteps √ó neurons)

Modes:

  Regression (`mode = [0]`)
  Four-class classification (`mode = [4]`)
  Two-class classification (`mode = [i, j]`)

Cross-validation: 10-fold stratified.

Metrics reported: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, MSE, RMSE, MAE, R¬≤ (depending on task).

Outputs: Results saved as CSV and plots (accuracy curves, confusion matrices, performance metrics).

üìä Outputs

All results are automatically saved in the `./model results/` directory:

Accuracy plots (`train_4class.jpg`, `test_4class.jpg`, etc.)
Confusion matrices (`train_4class_CM.jpg`, `test_4class_CM.jpg`)
Performance metrics (CSV):

  Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity
  MSE, RMSE, MAE, R¬≤ (for regression)
  Runtime statistics

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Code

1. Preprocess EEG into spike-encoded HDF5 (via NeuCube).
2. Run the classification script:

   python preprocessing_clean.py

3. Modify `mode` inside the script to switch between tasks:

   `mode = [0]` ‚Üí Regression
   `mode = [4]` ‚Üí 4-class classification
   `mode = [i, j]` ‚Üí 2-class classification
